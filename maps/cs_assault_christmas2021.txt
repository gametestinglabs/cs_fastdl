Description:
An imaginary situation in an imaginary place.
USA, New York, NYC, December 25th, 2021. Approximately
 at 18:57 a group of heavily armed suspects approached 
the Blargo Corp. warehouse at 72th street on a black 
van, kicked the back door open and started an armed 
raid, looking for what appears to be large sum of money, 
secretly smuggled by the warehouse owners. One of the 
security team members pushed alarm button and what was 
supposed to be a quick hit-and-run job for the criminals, 
turned into a barricaded hostage situation. Calls and 
negotiations didn't succeed. After securing the perimeter 
and escorting all of the civillians away from the 
dangerous area, CT unit is ready to start the operation 
on releasing the hostages. Little do they know, however, 
is that local intellegence seriously miscalculated the 
amount of criminals barricaded inside the warehouse and 
their military experience, so that operation risks 
to turn into a cursed bloodbath.

Other Notes: There are 4 hostages
in the mission. 2 are located upstairs, while other 2
are in main hall. CTs can use bridge and break themselves
a new entrance.
